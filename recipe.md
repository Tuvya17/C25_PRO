First, lay the nachos in a nice pattern on the plate(you are going to serve your costumer).
Then, apply mayonnaise in a diagnal direction. Apply pizza sauce in the same manner but the opposite diagnol direction to that of the mayonnaise.
The next step is to sprinkle a little capsicum and a lot of tomato.
Last step is to add shredded cheese on top(good aount of it) and then add the origano & chilli flakes to give your nacho dish a FINISHED look!

& THEN ENJOY :)
